/**
 GRAPHS

A graph is like a map of cities connected by roads. 

The cities are called vertices or nodes, and the roads connecting them are called edges. 
Just like how you can drive from one city to another by taking different roads,
in a graph you can travel between vertices by following the edges.

Some cities might have more roads leading into and out of them, making them more connected. 
Other cities might only have a few roads, so they are less connected. Graphs are useful for modeling and 
analyzing relationships and networks, like road maps, social networks, or computer networks,
 by showing how different things are connected.
