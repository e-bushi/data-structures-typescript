DICTIONARIES

A dictionary is like the table of contents in a book. (different analogy from toys)

The words or topics (keys) are listed in the table of contents. Next to each word is a page number (value) 
that tells you where to find information about that word or topic in the book. 

Instead of reading through the whole book, you can just look up the word in the table of contents to quickly jump to the right page.
